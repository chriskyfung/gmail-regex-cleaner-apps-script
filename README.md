## About The Project

This project provides a flexible way to automatically clean up your Gmail inbox by deleting old emails that match specific criteria defined by regular expressions. It's perfect for managing recurring emails like newsletters, notifications, and alerts that you don't need to keep forever.

### Features

*   Delete old emails in Gmail that match a regular expression
*   Specify the number of days to keep the emails
*   Exclude starred, important, or labeled emails from deletion
*   Run the script manually or on a schedule
*   Log the deleted emails and errors

## Getting Started

> [!WARNING]
> This script will delete your emails permanently, without moving them to the trash. Please use it with caution and make sure you have a backup of your important emails. You can run the script with the `isDryRun` option set to `true` first to see what emails will be deleted.

This section will guide you through the process of setting up and running the script.

### Prerequisites

*   A Google account with access to Gmail and Google Drive.

### Installation

1.  Create a new Google Apps Script project in Google Drive.
2.  Copy and paste the code from `dist/code.js` and `dist/examples.js` into the script editor.
3.  From the `examples.js` file, choose a function that matches your needs, or create a new one. You can then run this function from the Apps Script editor.

    For example, to run one of the pre-made functions, you would select it in the editor's function list and click **Run**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running the script for the first time, you may need to authorize it to access your Gmail account.

4.  Optionally, set up a trigger to run a function periodically. You can do this by clicking the **Triggers** icon in the left sidebar, then clicking the **Add a trigger** button, and choosing the options you want. For example, you can set the script to run every day, week, or month.
